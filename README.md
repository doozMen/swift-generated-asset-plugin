# swift-generated-asset-plugin

This is an example to accompany a question about resources added via plugins to the `pluginWorkinDirectory`.

As you can see in the plugin code this code only works if you use a `prebuild` command.
It does not work for a buildTool command. Which is unfortunate as `prebuild` commands are ran all the 
time.
